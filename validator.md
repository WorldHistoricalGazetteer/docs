## WHGazetteer Contributions app wireframes

*Draft for comment, 9 Oct 2018*

We are building three interfaces to World-Historical Gazetteer data, and work is well under way (initial Alpha release, early 2019):

- **Contributions** (reconciliation, validation)
- **Application Programming Interface** (API)
- **Graphical search and browse** (GUI)

One primary goal of the project is to make contributing data a relatively simple process, requiring a minimum of intervention by WHG project staff. The following are proposed steps for contributing:

- **Register as a user with contributing privileges**
- **Upload place data in [Linked Places format]() or CSV** (or annotation data [*future*])
- **View/edit datasets in user dashboard**
- **Submit dataset for reconciliation with one or more authority**
- **Validate hits returned by reconciliation step**
- **When dataset status is ok, submit as contribution**
- **Cursory check of submission by WHG**
- **Dataset added to WHG database and 'registry index'**

Easy! ;^)

The following screens indicate what we have in mind to build. They are schematic, indicating required functionality and not appearance. Comments as issues in this repo, or by email or twitter are welcome. Work is commencing, so sooner the better.
